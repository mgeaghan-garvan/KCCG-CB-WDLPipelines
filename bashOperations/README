README

These scripts are used to transfer files from one bucket to another based on a Terra sample table.

Intructions:
1. Download a Terra sample.tsv table of existing repository (example here: SV_samples_upload.tsv)
2. Populate the searchTerms.txt file for strings to grep search. Folders containing this string will be created in the 
destination repository. E.g. "manta" will move files under the columns "manta_vcf", "manta_annotsv" etc to a "manta folder"
3. run the python script:

 python3 moveFiles.py -i SV_samples_upload.tsv -m searchTerms.txt -d outputDest -o SV_samples_new_repository.tsv
 python3 moveFiles.py -i SV_samples_upload.tsv -m searchTerms.txt -d fc-a8ec39f9-838e-4fb9-9104-8b3feabbaf30 -o SV_samples_exResGermline.tsv
 This should give a file "SV_samples_new_repository.tsv" that can be uploaded to Terra once the files have migrated
 outputDest is your new bucket. Do not include gs. eg. 
4. Run
paste oldList.txt newList.txt > pathChanges.txt
This will merge the list of old file paths and new file paths into a file called pathChanges.txt
Check that the file pathChanges.txt looks decent before proceeding!! It should have two columns: one with old path and one with new.
Note that empty entries in the existing table will turn up > provided that the 1st cell is empty, no operation will be performed.
5. Run
bash bash_transfer_gcp.sh pathChanges.txt
Note that line 17 is by default commented out. Check the outputs to ensure that the file works and the moves make sense before uncommenting and starting the move!!
6. Check the new repository to see if these files exist!

Notes: currently cannot handle Array[File] formats: only one path per cell allowed
